From our analysis it does not appear that the Vine reviewers were positively biased towards the products. We can see this from the percentage of 5 star reviews being 11.39% less in the Vine reviewers than the non-vine reviewers.**
I believe that the Vine reviewers were more careful in their reviews and less likely to hand out a 5 star if they were happy with the product. This is because they most likely would want their reviews to be honest and thorough as possible. We can look at things such as the word count in each review to show how carefully the vine reviewer explained their thoughts in detail versus the non-vine reviewer. Additionally, it would be worth while to see the number of 1-star reviews given by Vine reviewers versus non-vine reviewers. The percentage of One star reviews for non vine reviews is 14.92% while the vine reviews only had one star reviews 2.4% of the time. This shows that non vine reviewers were more likely to give a max review (positive or negative) than the Vine reviewers.
